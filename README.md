# Real-Time-Emotion-Recognition-Using-LBP-and-SVM
This project delves into the domain of computer vision and ML to achieve real-time emotion recognition, utilizing Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The goal is to accurately identify and classify five key emotions: Anger, Happiness, Neutral, Fear, and Sadness from real-time facial expressions captured through a webcam.

# Project Overview
Feature Extraction: Uses Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to detail facial textures.
Emotion Classification: Employs Support Vector Machine (SVM) for efficient and precise emotion categorization.

# Dataset
The custom dataset comprises self-captured images labeled with the corresponding emotions, providing a foundation for training and testing the classifier.

# Technologies
• MATLAB and Computer Vision System Toolbox
• Image Processing Toolbox
• MATLAB Support Package for USB Webcams

# Usage
Run the provided scripts in sequential order to set up the database, train the model, and execute real-time emotion recognition.
